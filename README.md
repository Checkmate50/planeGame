A top-down shooter we're building in Unity

## Setup

Install [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), get a (free) account / license, and install version 2020.2.1f1 (as of 1/9/2021 at least).  From here, it should be possible to "add" this library into Unity Hub and open it.  To test that this all worked, try to run the game by opening it and pressing the "play" button -- something should happen that isn't a crash (as of 1/9/2021, you'll be dropped into a shooter environment where you can move with WASD and fire with "space").
